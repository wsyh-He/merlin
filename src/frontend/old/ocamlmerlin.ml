(** # Merlin's pipeline
  *
  * The toplevel read and write JSON objects on stdin/stdout
  * Each read object corresponds to a command in the following format:
  *   ["command_name",arg1,arg2]
  * Arguments are command-specific. The ["help"] command list existing
  * commands.
  * The type of answer is also command-specific following this convention:
  * - ["return",result]
  *   the command executed successfully, returning `result' json object
  * - ["error",e]
  *   the command was not able to do it's job, for instance due to wrong
  *   assumptions, missing files, etc.
  * - ["failure",string]
  *   the command was not invoked correctly (for instance, trying to
  *   execute unknown command, or passing invalid arguments, etc)
  * - ["exception",string]
  *   something bad or unexpected happened, this is probably a bug and
  *   should have been caught as either an error or a failure.
  *   Please report!
  *
  * ## Overview
  *
  * Normal usage relies on the "tell" command, whose parameter is
  * source code:
  *   > ["tell","struct","let foo = 42"]  ; send buffer content
  *   < ["return","false"]
  *   > ["tell","struct",null]            ; signal end-of-buffer
  *   < ["return","true"]
  * The command ["seek","before",{"line":int,"col":int}] moves the cursor.
  * A session is a sequence of tell/seek commands to synchronize the
  * buffer and the editor, and of query commands.
  *
  * ## Incremental analysis
  *
  * The source code analysis pipeline is as follows:
  *   outline_lexer | outline_parser | chunk_parser | typer
  * Modulo some implementation details, we have:
  *   outline_lexer  : Lexing.buffer -> Raw_parser.token
  *   outline_parser : Raw_parser.token -> Outline_utils.kind * Raw_parser.token list
  *   chunk_parser   : Outline_utils.kind * Raw_parser.token list -> Parsetree.structure
  *   typer          : Parsetree.structure -> Env.t * Typedtree.structure
  *
  * Incremental update of those analyses is implemented through the
  * History.t data. Such an history is a list zipper, the cursor
  * position marking the split between "past", "present" and
  * "potential future".
  * The "past" is the list of already-validated definitions (you may
  * think of the highlighted code in Coqide/ProofGeneral), with the
  * element at the left of the cursor being the last wellformed definition.
  * The "potential future" is a list of definitions that have already
  * been validated, but will be invalidated and thrown out if the
  * definition under the cursor changes.
